//
//        there are three types of variables
//        Local scope  // it is defined inside an function
//        Class scope  //
//        Static scope // when main method is declared to it is defined or
//                        declared when we use static in any variable so it will become global its memory would not be deallocated it the whole program
                      // we can make variable and function static but we cannot make class static
